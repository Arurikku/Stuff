Stuff i made

## findString

- Can be used to find a specific string in a directory (takes time for big ones)
- Can find a specific combination of bytes using the same way
- Also a handy tool to convert an integer into it's byte array (4 bytes)

## snake console

It's snake... but in the windows console... and it shrinks... that's it...

## coolLEDserver

>What you need:
> - An ESP32
> - [The ESP32 EEPROM uploader tool](https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin/releases)
> - A 16 led adafruit neopixel ring

Creates an access point called Epic with passypoop as password and a website on it's ip address (says in the serial).

On the website (im bad at html so its ugly) you can control the leds with the sliders and by clicking the led to change.

Also there's a white slider for the brightness.

To send the info to the ring there's a send button
