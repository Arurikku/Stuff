## findString.exe

- Can be used to find a specific string in a directory (takes time for big ones)
- Can find a specific combination of bytes using the same way
- Also a handy tool to convert an integer into it's byte array (4 bytes)

## snake console

It's snake... but in the windows console... and it shrinks... that's it...
